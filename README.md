## üöÄ Introduction

 **InternLelo ‚Äì Internship Portal**
InternLelo is a responsive, user-friendly internship portal built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit. Designed to streamline the internship discovery and application process, this portal allows students to explore various opportunities across different domains like frontend development, marketing, and design.

The landing page features an animated hero section using Framer Motion to create an engaging first impression. The UI supports light and dark themes, ensuring accessibility and visual comfort across all devices, including mobile. Users can browse internship listings with detailed descriptions, responsibilities, and start dates. Each internship has a dedicated detail page, and candidates can apply through a dynamic application form, ensuring a seamless flow.

State management is handled with Redux, enabling smooth navigation and user interactions without unnecessary re-renders. The design is clean and modern, using Tailwind‚Äôs utility-first classes to maintain consistency and performance.

This project emphasizes real-world job search experience and showcases full-stack integration readiness, offering scalability for backend connection via Express.js or Firebase in the future. InternLelo stands as a practical tool for both learning and deployment in real educational or training environments.
